      "1": {
        "question": "Is B4OS really free? Are there hidden costs?",
        "answer": "<strong>Yes, B4OS is 100% free.</strong> There are no registration fees, paid materials, or hidden costs of any kind. The program is funded by the Satoshi Library to make professional-quality Bitcoin education accessible to Spanish-speaking developers."
      },
      "2": {
        "question": "Is all the developed code open source?",
        "answer": "<strong>Absolutely.</strong> All code developed as part of the B4OS program is open source and follows FOSS principles. Participants contribute to real open source projects in the Bitcoin ecosystem, including Bitcoin Core and Lightning Network."
      },
      "3": {
        "question": "What Bitcoin technologies are taught?",
        "answer": "<strong>B4OS focuses on Bitcoin Core and Lightning Network development.</strong> You'll learn C++, P2P architecture, transaction validation, payment channels, and contribute to real projects. We don't cover other cryptocurrencies - only Bitcoin and its ecosystem."
      },
      "4": {
        "question": "Do I need previous experience programming Bitcoin?",
        "answer": "<strong>You don't need Bitcoin experience, but you do need basic programming knowledge.</strong> You should have experience with at least one language (Python, C++, JavaScript), Git, and command line. We'll teach you everything specific to Bitcoin from scratch."
      },
      "5": {
        "question": "How much time should I dedicate to the program weekly?",
        "answer": "<strong>We recommend 8-10 hours weekly</strong> during the 24 weeks of the program. This includes 3 hours of weekly Socratic seminars, 2-3 hours of preparatory reading, and 3-4 hours of coding practice and projects."
      },
      "6": {
        "question": "Can I choose my learning path?",
        "answer": "<strong>Yes, after the first 8 weeks</strong> you can specialize by choosing between: Bitcoin Core Protocol Development, Lightning Network Development, or Application Development. Your mentor will help you choose according to your professional interests."
      },
      "7": {
        "question": "How do Socratic seminars work?",
        "answer": "<strong>They are 3-hour interactive sessions</strong> where we explore Bitcoin concepts through questions and group discussion. They are not lectures - they include prior preparation, open discussion, live coding, and immediate practical application."
      },
      "8": {
        "question": "Are recordings of the sessions available?",
        "answer": "<strong>We don't record the seminars</strong> to maintain a safe and private learning environment. Instead, we provide detailed post-session summaries, supplementary study materials, and make-up sessions for special cases."
      },
      "9": {
        "question": "What technical tools do I need to install?",
        "answer": "<strong>We'll set up the tools together in the first week:</strong> Git, Bitcoin Core, code editor (VS Code/CLion), GCC/Clang compilers, and Python 3.8+. Minimum requirements: 8GB RAM, 500GB available storage."
      },
      "10": {
        "question": "What results can I expect upon completion?",
        "answer": "<strong>Tangible and verifiable achievements:</strong> Minimum of 3 accepted contributions to Bitcoin Core or Lightning Network, a functional personal project, direct connections with senior Bitcoin developers, and a verifiable certificate with your specific contributions."
      },
      "11": {
        "question": "How does B4OS connect me with job opportunities?",
        "answer": "<strong>Direct partnerships with Bitcoin companies:</strong> Guaranteed interviews for the top 20% of graduates, exclusive job board for alumni, personal references from mentors, and networking events with Bitcoin recruiters."
      },
      "12": {
        "question": "Are there geographic or age restrictions?",
        "answer": "<strong>There are no geographic restrictions.</strong> B4OS is open to developers from any country who speak Spanish. Minimum age: 18 years. Schedules are coordinated considering the diversity of time zones of the participants."
      },
      "13": {
        "question": "Where can I send feedback or report issues?",
        "answer": "<strong>Multiple channels available:</strong> Main email <a href=\"mailto:hola@b4os.dev\">hola@b4os.dev</a>, Discord community for direct chat, GitHub Issues for technical reports, and regular feedback sessions during the program."
